<!--
The following code refers to the template returned to the search engine that is running http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for the user. It is important to note that
flask enables the rendering of the results.html page. First the title of the page is made and a font is taken from google. Next is all the css styling that 
allows for the the spacing and alignment of text and pictures within the results page. An explanation of the results follows the styling. Then comes
the image that was made and edited in the home function in app.py through flask handling the user requests and dyanmically creating a football field image
with the user's input. The same home function in app.py that flask is managing provides results.html a chatgpt response in the results.html rendered template.
The chatgpt response is placed below the football field image and a reset button navigating back to index.html is set as well.
